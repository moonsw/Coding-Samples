GEEKOS BUILD DIRECTORY:

The Build Directory of GeekOS has makefiles for starting QEMU with GeekOS and
user programs. It's subdirectories (which can be initially empty) holds object
and executable modules. In particular, there will be two disk images: diskc,
containing a PFAT filesystem with the GeekOS image and user programs; and diskd,
initially raw and empty.
